<h1>Distributions!</h1>
<br>
<h2>What is a distribution?</h2>
<p>A distribution is a set of data that shows all the possible values of a given variable. Specifically, a normal distribution <br>
is a distribution that has the mean, median, and mode all at the same value, and there are equal amounts of the given variable<br>
on either side of the mean.</p>
<br>
<h2>Parts of a Distribution</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Level- the central tendencies of a distribution such as mean, median, and mode.</li>
  
  <br>
  
  <li>Spread- how far apart the data points are from one another</li>
  <li>Shape- what the data looks like</li>
  <li>Outliers- irregular data points that are found beyond the rest of the data points</li>
</ul>
